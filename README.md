# 911 Agent

**Overview**  
Our project, **911 Agent**, leverages AI agents to enhance and partially automate the 911 emergency response system in the United States. By integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence, we aim to address current limitations within the 911 infrastructure, ensuring faster, more efficient, and accessible emergency services for all.

**Problem Statement**  
The 911 system is a critical lifeline for those in need of urgent assistance, connecting people with police, fire, and medical services. However, the system faces ongoing challenges:
- **Dispatcher Shortages**: Due to manpower constraints, callers can experience delays, which is especially concerning in life-threatening situations where time is crucial.
- **Language Barriers**: The diverse population in the U.S. includes many individuals with limited English proficiency, creating communication challenges that can impact response accuracy and speed.
- **Accessibility Issues**: Current services may not adequately support disabled or mute individuals, underscoring the need for an inclusive, tech-driven solution.

**Our Solution**  
The **911 Agent** project introduces AI agents as an augmentation to existing 911 services, enabling the following features:
- **Real-Time Threat Analysis**: Multiple AI agents analyze caller tone and background sounds to identify urgency and potential threats, assisting dispatchers in prioritizing and routing calls more effectively.
- **Multilingual Capabilities**: With built-in support for multiple languages, our AI agents remove the dependency on human translators, reducing response time and minimizing miscommunication.
- **Flexible Access Options**: Users can connect through video, audio, or text interfaces, selecting the communication method that best suits their situation. This adaptability makes the service more accessible to individuals with diverse needs.
